ultraedit.txt  is a 'WordFile.txt' addition for Ultraedit
(http://www.ultraedit.com/) that hightlights Velocity keywords. 

It was originally contributed by Herve Guidetti 
<Herve.Guidetti@idbsoft.ch> with additional tweaks and 
comments by Wido Hillmann <wido.hillmann@epost.de>
and Stephane Bailliez <sbailliez@apache.org>

1)  Go into UltraEdit home directory.
2)  Add the content of the file to the end of your word.txt file
3)  Modify the number on the first line (/L9 in this case), so that it matches
your word.txt definition. (it's incremental)
4)  Edit a .vm template with UltraEdit. You should now have syntax coloring
for Velocimacros.
