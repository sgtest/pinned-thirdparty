Misc Notes
==========

Context 'Scope'
--------------
JSP has this notion of three levels of scope for passing data
through to the JSP - context, session and request (hereafter c/s/r)

Now, there is no such notion in Vel, but it's important to the JSP
crowd, for now anyway :)

So, maybe the solution is two-fold : 

when taking c/s/r elements to package into the context, maybe the solution is :

- make a new VC c/s/r
- chain them :  VC(r) = new VC( VC(s) = new VC(c)) so r masks s masks c
- also, place those VC's independantly into the context 
   $struts.context
   $struts.session
   $struts.request

- we can also wrap in VMs :
   #context( <key> )
   #session( <key> )
   #request( <key> )

  or something


Beanification of Tags
---------------------

It would be nice to map the tags into VMs.  Currently there are two tags 
that have been velocitized, <bean:message -> $message and 
<html:errors -> $errors.getErrors()

A nice solution would be auto-generation of the bean mappings at startup, so it
can do it from the standard struts configuration files.  Not sure how easy this
is, but I think it can be done.

ex.

<bean:message ->  #message_bean( <key> )

<html:errors -> #errors_html( <key> )


something like that.  I hope it can be done automatically.

The problem will be things that expect a body, like

<logic:equals

In Velocity, we can finagle it so

#if( #equals_logic( ) )
 ....
#end

does the right thing.  That shouldn't be hard.
