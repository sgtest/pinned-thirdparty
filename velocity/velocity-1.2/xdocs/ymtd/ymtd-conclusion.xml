<section name="Conclusion">

<p>
We hope that you enjoyed this little excursion into the land of
alternatives. Every developer and user in the world has their own
opinion on the "right way" to do things. The goal of this document is
not to force anyone to believe that the Velocity way is the "Right Way",
but instead to let people see the differences between the two approaches
and allow one to develop their own opinions about the tools that are in
use today.
</p>

<p>
Some people may disagree strongly with this essay because it challenges
conventional thinking as well as the way that they may be doing things
today. It is very difficult to show people who believe strongly in
something that there might be another solution out there that solves
problems in a different way. Therefore, please send us your feedback as
it really is important. Instructions for doing so are on the first page.
</p>

<p>
You make the decision.
