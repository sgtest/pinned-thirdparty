<strong>Hey, Maybe We're On The Right Track After All...</strong>
<blockquote>
Give <a href="http://www.caucho.com/products/resin/ref/velocity.xtp">this</a>
a read.  The latest version of <a href="http://www.caucho.com/">Resin</a>, a 
popular servlet engine, has added what they call a "Velocity-like syntax" to their JSP 
implementation.  As they say on their site :
<blockquote>
<i>"The Resin-2.0.3 release allows an alternate JSP expression syntax similar to the Apache Velocity project that many find more maintainable than the JSP pointy brackets. Resin's syntax extension is compatible with the usual JSP features like tag libraries."
</i>
</blockquote>

We do think that this is a step in the right direction for JSPs, making the page content easier to
write and maintain. 
<br/>
<br/>
However, we want to emphasize to users that this isn't the same thing as using
Velocity - this is a small subset of the Velocity syntax which 
was reimplemented in Resin.
<br/>
<br/>
 Velocity is much more than an alternative syntax to the scriptlets and
tags found in JSPs - it's a full-featured templating engine, fully portable to any
J2EE servlet container, that offers many advanges over JSPs in the J2EE
web application environment.  It also an excellent templating tool
for other kinds of applications written in Java.
<br/>
<br/>
So if you are interested in portable alternatives to JSP, we strongly 
encourage you look deeper into what Velocity has to offer.
<br/>
<br/>
And if you must use JSPs and want to incorporate Velocity into your
current or new JSP-based web applications, take a look at our
<a href="veltag.html">Veltag</a> JSP taglib which allows the full 
power of Velocity in your JSPs.

documentation.

<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.webtechniques.com/archives/2001/09/serv/">Getting Up
to Speed with Velocity</a> is a really well written article by Jim
Jagielski about the merits of using a tool like Velocity.

<blockquote>
Many people believe that Velocity can only be used in the context of web
applications. This excellent <a

article</a> by Leon Messerschmidt shows that the design of Velocity is
such that it can be used in a myriad of applications.

 <section name="What is Velocity?">

 <p>
    Velocity is a Java-based template engine. It permits anyone to use
    the simple yet powerful template language to reference objects
    defined in Java code.
 </p>
 
 <p>
    When Velocity is used for web development, Web designers can work in
    parallel with Java programmers to develop web sites according to the
    Model-View-Controller (MVC) model, meaning that web page designers
    can focus solely on creating a site that looks good, and programmers
    can focus solely on writing top-notch code. Velocity separates Java
    code from the web pages, making the web site more maintainable over
    the long run and providing a viable alternative to <a
    href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/">Java Server Pages</a>
    (JSPs) or <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>.
 </p>

 <p>
    Velocity's capabilities reach well beyond the realm of web sites; for
    example, it can generate SQL and PostScript and XML (see <a
    href="./anakia.html">Anakia</a> for more information on XML transformations)
    from templates.  It can be used either as a standalone utility for
    generating source code and reports, or as an integrated component of other
    systems.  Velocity also provides template services for the
    <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/">Turbine</a> web application
    framework. Velocity+Turbine  provides a template service that will allow
    web applications to be developed according to a true MVC model.
